### Task 1
  - [PanDocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)
  - [Zig's Build System](https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/)

### Task 2
  - For graphics, [capy](https://capy-ui.org) seems like a good starting point
  - No idea what to do for audio, sounds difficult and mathy
  - Capy didn't build for some reason, I may be dumb though

### Task 3
  - Figure out how to read in rom / decode
  - Moved tests to appropriate locations
  - Made cart header library, will parse more out later for PP func
  - Instructions between 1 and 3 bytes, CB always 2.
  - Added handling framework and decode loop, just worked nop
  - Also, should figure out how to map rom in to memory

### Task 4
