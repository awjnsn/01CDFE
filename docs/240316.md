## Tasks

1. Grab documentation
2. Figure out libraries
3. Mappers
4. Implementation

### Task 1
  - [PanDocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)
  - [Zig's Build System](https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/)
  - [Instruction Encoding](https://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html)
  - [Old Decoder Project](https://github.com/awjnsn/gbdump)
  - [Test Roms](https://github.com/c-sp/gameboy-test-roms)
  - [Instructions](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.7.0/gbz80.7)

### Task 2
  - For graphics, [capy](https://capy-ui.org) seems like a good starting point
  - No idea what to do for audio, sounds difficult and mathy
  - Capy didn't build for some reason, I may be dumb though
  - Just use SDL?

### Task 3
  - [Mapper](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/MBCs.html)
  - Added mapper enum to header, may need to add more
  - Fixed missing ROM ONLY, started testing against TETRIS since it is ROM ONLY
  - Added ROM ONLY mapper and debug function for dumping the memory

### Task 4
  - Did initial `xor` implementation
  - `ld` probably next
  - Why are we hitting an `FF` `RST $38`, apparently that isn't right per
    [StackOverflow](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15116/how-does-the-rst-operation-of-gameboy-sharp-lr35902-work)
  - Fixed, wasn't adding enough to PC
  - Added all `ld < 0x80`
  - Added inc/dec
  - Added helper function for incrementing PC
  - I think I'll move memory access over to a function so I can add special cases
  - Added read/write byte/Word and associated testing, I figure it will be useful
    when we have to add special handling for certain memory locations
  - Added condition code enums in prep for `jr` instruction
  - Added `DI`/`EI`
  - `LDH (a8),A`, `LDH A,(a8)`, `LD (a16),A`, `LD A,(a16)`
