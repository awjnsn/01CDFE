## Tasks

1. Grab documentation
2. Figure out libraries
3. Decoding
4. Mappers
5. Implementation

### Task 1
  - [PanDocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)
  - [Zig's Build System](https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/)
  - [Instruction Encoding](https://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html)
  - [Old Decoder Project](https://github.com/awjnsn/gbdump)
  - [Test Roms](https://github.com/c-sp/gameboy-test-roms)
  - [Instructions](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.7.0/gbz80.7)

### Task 2
  - For graphics, [capy](https://capy-ui.org) seems like a good starting point
  - No idea what to do for audio, sounds difficult and mathy
  - Capy didn't build for some reason, I may be dumb though

### Task 3
  - Figure out how to read in rom / decode
  - Moved tests to appropriate locations
  - Made cart header library, will parse more out later for PP func
  - Instructions between 1 and 3 bytes, CB always 2.
  - Added handling framework and decode loop, just worked nop
  - Also, should figure out how to map rom in to memory
  - Started copying over pastraiser instruction info

### Task 4
  - [Mapper](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/MBCs.html)
  - Added mapper enum to header, may need to add more
  - Fixed missing ROM ONLY, started testing against TETRIS since it is ROM ONLY
  - Added ROM ONLY mapper and debug function for dumping the memory

### Task 5
  - Did initial `xor` implementation
  - `ld` probably next
  - Why are we hitting an `FF` `RST $38`, apparently that isn't right per
